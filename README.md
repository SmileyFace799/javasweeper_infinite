# Infinite Minesweeper, now in Java!
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Development of this is currently on hiatus,
as a complete rewrite in an actual game engine (probably C# w/Godot) is planned sometime in the future.
The Java version of this will no longer receive updates</p>

### Here's some sample gameplay from the final "stable" version in Java
